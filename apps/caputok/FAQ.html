    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <h2>What is the Caputok App?</h2>
    <p>Caputok is a simple tool that analyzes a text file and provides a list of non-followers. It offers a clean interface. Many people search for tools online to find out who unfollowed them on TikTok. This app is dedicated to users who want to keep their following list clean.</p>

    <h2>Why is it needed?</h2>
    <p>There are many apps in the Google Play Store and other app stores that claim to help users find TikTok unfollowers. However, most of them are actually designed for other social media platforms, not TikTok. Caputok is solely dedicated to helping TikTok users and making their task easier. It has nothing to do with other social media platforms.</p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>It works based on a simple logic. It analyzes the 'following' file and the 'followers' file, then identifies the usernames that are in the first file but not in the second. For a user guide, visit <a href="#">this link</a>.</p>

    <h2>Do I really need it?</h2>
    <p>It is completely your choice. If you have more than 1,000 followings, care about keeping your following list clean, and do not have time to manually check each user, then this app is for you. Just try it and leave a review.</p>

    <h2>How can I get this app?</h2>
    <p>Currently, Caputok is only available in the Oppo App Market in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Russia, the Philippines, Taiwan-China, and Vietnam. If you have an Oppo phone and are in one of these regions, you can download and use it. If you have an Oppo phone but are outside these regions, you can change your phone's region settings to one of the supported regions and search for it in the Oppo App Market. If you do not have an Oppo phone, you can ask a friend with an Oppo device to help you download it.</p>

    <h2>Why is this not in the Google Play Store or Apple App Store?</h2>
    <p>We plan to release it gradually in more regions and on more app stores soon.</p>
