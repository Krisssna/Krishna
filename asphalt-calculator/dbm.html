    <h1>DENSE BITUMINOUS MACADAM</h1>

    <h2>(1) Scope</h2>
    <p>The specification describes the design and construction procedure for Dense Bituminous Macadam, (DBM), for use mainly, but not exclusively, in base/binder and profile corrective courses. The work shall consist of construction in a single or multiple layers of DBM on a previously prepared base or sub-base. The thickness of a single layer shall be 50 mm to 100 mm.</p>

    <h2>(2) Materials</h2>
    
    <h3>(a) Bitumen</h3>
    <p>The bitumen shall be viscosity grade paving bitumen complying with the Indian Standard Specification IS: 73, modified bitumen complying with IS 15462 or as otherwise specified in the Contract.</p>
    <p>The type and grade of bitumen to be used shall be specified in the Contract.</p>
    
    <h3>(b) Coarse Aggregates</h3>
    <p>The coarse aggregates shall consist of crushed rock, crushed gravel or other hard material retained on 2.36 mm sieve. They shall be clean, hard, and durable, of cubical shape, free from dust and soft or friable matter, organic or other deleterious substances.</p>
    <p>Where the Contractor's selected source of aggregates has poor affinity for bitumen, the Contractor shall produce test results that with the use of anti-stripping agents, the stripping value is improved to satisfy the specification requirements. The Engineer may approve such a source and as a condition for the approval of that source, the bitumen shall be treated with an approved anti-stripping agent, as per the manufacturer's recommendations, at the cost of the Contractor. The aggregates shall satisfy the requirements specified in Table 13.26</p>
    <p>Where crushed gravel is proposed for use as aggregate, not less than 90 percent by weight of the crushed material retained on the 4.75 mm sieve shall have at least two fractured faces.</p>

        <p>* To determine this combined proportion, the flaky stone from a representative sample should first be separated out. Flakiness index is weight of flaky stone metal divided by weight of stone sample. Only the elongated particles are separated out from the remaining (non-flaky) stone metal. Elongation index is weight of elongated particles divided by total non-flaky particles. The values of flakiness index and elongation index so found are added up.</p>

    <h3>(c) Fine Aggregates</h3>
    <p>Fine aggregates shall consist of crushed or naturally occurring mineral material, or a combination of the two, passing the 2.36 mm sieve and retained on the 75-micron sieve. These shall be clean, hard, durable, dry and free from dust, and soft or friable matter, organic or other deleterious matter. Natural sand shall not be allowed in binder courses. However, natural sand up to 50 percent of the fine aggregate may be allowed in base courses. The fine aggregate shall have a sand equivalent value of not less than 50 when tested in accordance with the requirement of IS: 2720 (Part 37). The plasticity index of the fraction passing the 0.425 mm sieve shall not exceed 4, when tested in accordance with IS: 2720 (Part 5).</p>
    
    <h3>(d) Filler</h3>
    <p>Filler shall consist of finely divided mineral matter such as rock dust, hydrated lime or cement approved by the Engineer. The filler shall be graded within the limits indicated in Table 13.27.</p>
    <p>The filler shall be free from organic impurities and have a plasticity Index not greater than 4. The Plasticity index requirement shall not apply if filler is cement or lime.</p>
    <p>Where the aggregates fail to meet the requirements of the water sensitivity test in Table 13.26, then 2 percent by total weight of aggregate, of hydrated lime shall be used and percentage of fine aggregate reduced accordingly.</p>

    <h3>(e) Site trials</h3>
    <p>Once the plant trials have been successfully completed and approved, the Contractor shall carry out laying trials, to demonstrate that the proposed mix can be successfully laid and compacted all in accordance with Clause 1301.</p>
    <p>The laying trial shall be carried out on a suitable area which is not to form part of the works. The area of the laying trials shall be a minimum of 100 sq.m of construction similar to that of the project road, and it shall be in all respects, particularly compaction, the same as the project construction, on which the bituminous material is to be laid.</p>
    <p>The Contractor shall previously inform the Engineer of the proposed method for laying and compacting the material. The plant trials shall then establish if the proposed laying plant, compaction plant, and methodology is capable of producing satisfactory results.</p>
    <p>The density of the finished paving layer shall be determined by taking cores, no sooner than 24 hours after laying, or by other approved method. The compacted layers of Dense Graded Bituminous Macadam (DBM) shall have a minimum field density equal to or more than 92% of the density based on theoretical maximum specific gravity (Gmm) obtained on the day of compaction in accordance with ASTM D 2041.</p>
    <p>Once the laying trials have been approved, the same plant and methodology shall be applied to the laying of the material on the project, and no variation of either shall be acceptable, unless approved in writing by the Engineer, who may at his discretion require further laying trials.</p>

    <h2>(4) Construction Operations</h2>
