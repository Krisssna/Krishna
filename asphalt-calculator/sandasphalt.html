    <h1>SAND ASPHALT</h1>

    <h2>(1) Scope</h2>
    <p>This Clause covers the materials, method of construction and requirements for the construction of Sand Asphalt.</p>

    <h2>(2) Definition</h2>
    <p>Sand Asphalt means a controlled, hot-mixed, hot-laid, plant mixture of sand and penetration grade bitumen.</p>

    <h2>(3) Materials</h2>
    
    <h3>(a) Sand</h3>
    <p>Sand shall consist of clean, tough, screened or crushed rough surfaced grains. As delivered to the mixer it shall be free from lumps or loosely bonded aggregations and the individual particles shall be free from adhering dust. It shall be non-plastic and Sand Equivalent shall be not less than 40. The grading shall be within the limits set out in the Table 13.38.</p>
    
    <table>
        <caption>Table 13.38: Grading Requirement of Sand</caption>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Sieve Size (mm)</th>
                <th>Percentage passing by weight</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>4.750</td>
                <td>100</td>

            <tr>
                <td>2.360</td>
                <td>76-100</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>0.600</td>
                <td>27-90</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>0.075</td>
                <td>6-14</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Sand which fails to meet this requirement may be used provided it is first mixed with other mineral products to produce a mixture which falls within the grading limits of Table 13.38 and has the specified Marshall Test stability.</p>
    
    <h3>(b) Mineral Filler</h3>
    <p>The mineral filler shall comply with Sub-Clause 1309 (3) (c).</p>
    
    <h3>(c) Binder</h3>
    <p>The binder shall be paving bitumen of VG 10 complying with the requirements specified in Section 600.</p>

    <h2>(4) Requirements for Sand Asphalt</h2>
    <p>The mixture shall comply with the following requirement:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Marshall Stability 50 blows (N): Min. 3,500</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The proportion, by weight of total mixture, of bitumen shall be stated in the Special Specification or in the Bill of Quantities. This shall be termed the nominal binder content. The binder content of the working/job mix shall be instructed by the Engineer following laboratory and site trials. The Contractor shall carry out such tests as the Engineer may require to determine the optimum mix composition of the job mix.</p>

    <h2>(5) Mixing and Laying Sand Asphalt</h2>
    <p>The mixture shall be transported, laid and compacted in accordance with Clause 1301. The minimum temperature of the mixture at the time of completion of rolling shall be not less than 80Â° C.</p>

    <h2>(6) Compaction</h2>
    <p>Rolling shall be sequence of roller in such a manner that it will ensure the full specified compaction and at the same time will provide a finished surface within the tolerance laid down in this Specification. The minimum in-situ density shall be 87% of the density of the Marshall specimens compacted forms the Approved Job Mix.</p>

    <h2>(7) Quality Control</h2>
    
    <h3>(a) Sampling</h3>
    <p>Prior to use the Contractor shall supply the Engineer with samples of all materials proposed to be used. He shall carry out all the specified tests as the Engineer may require to satisfy himself that the material and proportions satisfy this Specification. No material shall be used, nor job mix adopted until they are approved in writing by the Engineer.</p>
    <p>Sampling of mixes shall normally be carried out at the mixing plant or from Lorries conveying the material from the mixing plant to the paver, but the Engineer may direct for sampling to be carried out form the paver, if there is any danger of segregation of the mix during transporting and spreading process.</p>
    
    <h3>(b) Process Control</h3>
    <p>The minimum frequency of testing for process control shall be as given in the Table 5.2</p>
    <p>Routine inspection and testing shall be carried out by the Engineer to test the completed work for compliance with the dimensional tolerances, quality of material, density of compaction and any other requirements stated in this Specification.</p>
    <p>Any material and workmanship that do not comply with the requirements specified, shall be replaced by material and workmanship complying with their respective Specification.</p>

    <h2>(8) Measurement</h2>
    <p>Sand Asphalt concrete shall be measured cubic meter as the product of the length and the compacted cross-sectional area of the sand asphalt laid as per drawing or as instructed by the Engineer.</p>

    <h2>(9) Payment</h2>
    <p>The sand asphalt shall be paid as per contract unit rate which shall be the full and the final compensation for the cost of compliance of all requirements specified in Clause 1301 and 1312 in addition to those specified in Clause 112.</p>

    <h2>(10) Adjustment in Contract Unit Rate</h2>
    <p>If any variation between the specified (nominal) rates of application of binder, sand and/or mineral filler and their respective rate of application actually used in the work as per the direction of the Engineer, the contract unit rate for asphalt concrete shall be adjusted as per contract unit rate of the respective material quoted by the Contractor for the purpose of this variation.</p>
    <p>The varied sand asphalt shall be paid as per adjusted rate.</p>
