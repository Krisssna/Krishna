    <h3>(3) Construction Operations</h3>
    <p><strong>(a) Weather and Seasonal Limitations</strong><br>
    Clause 1301 (5) shall apply.</p>
    
    <p><strong>(b) Preparation of Surface</strong><br>
    The underlying surface on which the bituminous surfacing is to be laid shall be prepared, shaped and conditioned to the specified lines, grade and cross-section in accordance with Clause 1100. A prime coat where needed shall be applied in accordance with Clause 1302 as directed by the Engineer.</p>
    
    <p><strong>(c) Tack Coat</strong><br>
    A tack coat complying with Clause 1302, shall be applied over the base preparatory to laying of the surfacing.</p>
    
    <p><strong>(d) Preparation of Premix</strong><br>
    Hot mix plant of appropriate capacity and type shall be used for the preparation of the mix material. The hot mix plant shall have separate dryer arrangement for heating aggregate. The temperature of the binder and aggregate at the time of mixing, laying and compaction shall be in conformity with the temperature given in Table 13-5. The difference in temperature between the binder and aggregate shall at no time exceed 14°C. Mixing shall be thorough to ensure that a homogeneous mix is obtained in which all particles of the aggregates are coated uniformly. The mix shall be immediately transported from the mixer to the point of use in suitable vehicles or hand barrows. The vehicles employed for transport shall be clean and the mix being transported covered in transit if so directed by the Engineer.</p>
    
    <p><strong>(e) Spreading and Rolling</strong><br>
    The pre mixed material shall be spread on a previously prepared base by a paver or as directed by the Engineer to the desired thickness, grades and cross fall (camber). The cross-fall shall be checked by means of camber boards and irregularities levelled out. Excessive use of blades or rakes shall be avoided. As soon as sufficient length of bituminous material has been laid, rolling shall commence with 8-10 ton rollers, smooth wheel tandem type or other approved equipment. Rolling shall begin at the edge and progress towards the centre longitudinally, except that on super elevated and uni-directional cambered portions, it shall progress from the lower to upper edge parallel to the centre line of the pavement. When the roller has passed over the whole area once, any high spots or depressions, which become apparent, shall be corrected by removing or adding premixed materials. Rolling shall then be continued until the entire surface has been rolled and all the roller marks eliminated. In each pass of the roller the preceding track shall be overlapped uniformly by at least one third width. The roller wheels shall be kept damp to prevent the premix from adhering to the wheels. In no case shall fuel/lubricating oil be used for this purpose. Excess use of water for this purpose shall also be avoided. Rollers shall not stand on newly laid material. Rolling operations shall be completed in every respect before the temperature of the mix falls below the rolling temperature indicated in Table 13-5.</p>
    
    <p><strong>(f) Seal Coat</strong><br>
    A seal coat conforming to specification of the type specified in the Contract shall be applied to the surface immediately after laying the surfacing.</p>

    <h3>(4) Opening to Traffic</h3>
    <p>No traffic shall be allowed on the road until the seal coat has been laid. In the case of Type B seal coat, traffic may be allowed soon after final rolling when the premixed material has cooled down to the surrounding temperature. In the case of Type A seal coat, traffic shall not be permitted to run on any newly sealed area until the following day. In special circumstances, however, the Engineer may open the road to traffic immediately after rolling, but in such cases traffic shall be rigorously limited to 20 km per hour until the following day.</p>

    <h3>(5) Surface Finish and Quality Control of Work</h3>
    <p>The surface finish of construction shall conform to the requirements of Clause 1100. For control of the quality of materials and the works carried out, the relevant provisions of Section 500 shall apply.</p>

    <h3>(6) Arrangements for Traffic</h3>
    <p>During the period of construction, arrangements for traffic shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Clause 104.</p>

    <h3>(7) Measurement</h3>
    <p>Open graded premix surfacing shall be measured as finished work, for the area instructed to be covered, in square meters.</p>

    <h3>(8) Payment</h3>
    <p>Open-graded premix surfacing shall be paid as per contract unit rate which shall be the full and final compensation for the cost of compliance of all requirements of Clauses 1301 and 1311 in addition to those specified in Clause 112.</p>

    <h2>B. Open Graded Premix Surfacing Using Cationic Bitumen Emulsion</h2>

    <h3>(1) Scope</h3>
    <p>This work shall consist of the preparation, laying and compaction of an open graded premix surfacing of 20 mm thickness composed of small-sized aggregate premixed with a cationic bitumen emulsion on a previously prepared surface, in accordance with the requirements of these Specifications to serve as a wearing course.</p>

    <h3>(2) Materials</h3>
    <p><strong>(a) Binder</strong><br>
    The binder for Premix wearing course shall be Cationic Bitumen emulsion of Medium Setting (MS) grade complying with IS: 8887 or as specified in the Contract.</p>
    
    <p><strong>(b) Aggregate</strong><br>
    The requirements of Clause 1307 (2) shall apply.</p>

    <h3>(3) Proportioning of Materials</h3>
    <p>The materials shall be proportioned as per quantities given in Tables 13.37.</p>

    <h3>(4) Construction Operations</h3>
    <p><strong>(a) Weather and Seasonal Limitations</strong><br>
    Clause 1301 (5) shall apply except that the minimum air temperature for laying shall be 10°C. Cationic bitumen emulsions shall not normally be stored below 0°C.</p>
    
    <p><strong>(b) Preparation of Surface</strong><br>
    The underlying surface on which the bituminous surfacing is to be laid shall be prepared, shaped and conditioned to the specified lines, grade and cross-section in accordance with Clause 1100. A prime coat where needed shall be applied in accordance with Clause 1302 as directed by the Engineer.</p>
    
    <p><strong>(c) Preparation of Binder</strong><br>
    Before opening, the cationic bitumen emulsion drums shall be rolled at a slow speed, to and fro at least 5 times, for a distance of about 10 meters, to distribute any storage sedimentation.</p>
    
    <p><strong>(d) Tack Coat</strong><br>
    A tack coat complying with Clause 1302, shall be applied over the surface preparatory to laying of the surfacing where specified in the Contract, as directed by the Engineer.</p>
    
    <p><strong>(e) Preparation of Premix</strong><br>
    Premixing of cationic bitumen emulsion and aggregates can be carried out in a suitable mixer such as cold mixing plant as per IS: 5435 (Revised) or concrete mixer or by pay loaders in exceptional cases where approved by the Engineer. Where specified in the Contract, continuous mixing operation shall be done either in batch or continuous hot mix plant suitable for emulsion mixes. When using concrete mixer for preparing the premix, 0.135 cu.m (0.09 cu.m of 13.2 mm size and 0.045 cu.m of 11.2 mm size) of aggregates per batch shall be used. This quantity will be for 5 sq.m of road surface with 20 mm average thickness. The aggregates required for one batch shall be prepared adjacent to the mixer. The coarse aggregate of 13.2 mm size shall be placed into the mixer followed by 5 to 6.5 kg of Cationic bitumen emulsion and then the 11.2 mm size aggregate shall be added, followed by 5 to 6.5 kg of Cationic bitumen emulsion. After the materials have been mixed thoroughly, the mix shall be immediately transported to the laying site in suitable vehicles. Too much mixing shall be avoided.</p>
    
    <p><strong>(f) Spreading and Rolling</strong><br>
    The premixed cationic bitumen emulsion and aggregates shall be spread uniformly by a paver within 10 minutes of applying the tack coat. All levelling, raking etc. shall be completed within 20 minutes of the time of mixing. The mix shall be spread uniformly to the desired thickness, grades and cross fall (camber). The cross fall shall be checked by means of camber boards and irregularities levelled out. Too much raking is to be avoided. The rolling shall start immediately after laying the premix. A smooth wheeled tandem roller of 8-10 tons shall be used, unless other compaction methods are approved by the Engineer, based on the results of laying trials, if necessary. While rolling, wheels of roller shall be clean and kept moist to prevent the premix from adhering to the wheels. In no case shall fuel/lubricating oil be used for this purpose. Use of water for this purpose shall be strictly limited to an absolute minimum. Rolling shall commence at the edges and progress towards the centre longitudinally except in the case of super elevated and unidirectional cambered sections where rolling shall be carried out from the lower edge towards the higher edge parallel to the centre line of the road. After one pass of roller over the whole area, depressions or uncovered spots shall be corrected by adding premix material. Rolling shall be continued until the entire surface has been rolled, to maximum compaction and all the roller marks eliminated. In each pass of the roller, the preceding track shall be overlapped uniformly by at least one-third width. Roller(s) shall not stand on newly laid material. Joints, both longitudinal and transverse to the road sections laid and compacted earlier, shall be cut vertically to their full depth so as to expose fresh surface which shall be painted with a thin coat of binder before the new mix is laid.</p>

    <h3>(5) Seal Coat</h3>
    <p>A seal coat, conforming to relevant specification, as specified in the Contract, shall be applied immediately after laying the premix carpet.</p>

    <h3>(6) Opening to Traffic</h3>
    <p>Traffic shall not be allowed over the premix surface till seal coat is laid. After the seal coat is laid, traffic may be allowed in accordance with Clause 1305.</p>

    <h3>(7) Surface Finish and Quality Control</h3>
    <p>The surface finish of construction shall conform to the requirements of Clause 1100. For control of the quality of materials and work carried out, relevant provision of Section 900 shall apply.</p>

    <h3>(8) Arrangements for Traffic</h3>
    <p>During the period of construction, arrangements for traffic shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Clause 104.</p>

    <h3>(9) Measurement</h3>
    <p>Open graded premix surfacing shall be measured as finished work, for the area instructed to be covered, in square meters.</p>

    <h3>(10) Payment</h3>
    <p>Open-graded premix surfacing shall be paid as per contract unit rate which shall be the full and final compensation for the cost of compliance of all requirements of Clauses 1301 and 1311 in addition to those specified in Clause 112.</p>
