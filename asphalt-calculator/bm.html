    <h1>BITUMINOUS MACADAM</h1>

    <h2>(1) Scope</h2>
    <p>This Clause comprises all the general requirements for bituminous Macadam. This work shall consist of construction in a single course having 50 mm to 100 mm thickness or in multiple courses of compacted crushed aggregates premixed with a bituminous binder on a previously prepared base to the requirements of these Specifications.</p>
    <p class="note">Since then, Bituminous macadam is an open-graded mix, there is a potential that it may trap water or moisture vapour within the pavement system. Therefore, adjacent layer (shoulders) shall have proper drainage quality to prevent moisture-induced damage to the BM.</p>

    <h2>(2) Materials</h2>
    
    <h3>(a) Bitumen</h3>
    <p>The bitumen shall be viscosity graded paving bitumen complying with Indian Standard Specification for paving bitumen, IS: 73 or as specified in the Contract. The type and grade of bitumen to be used would depend upon the climatic conditions and the traffic. Guidelines for selection of bitumen are given in Table 13.1.</p>
    
    <h3>(b) Coarse Aggregates</h3>
    <p>The coarse aggregates shall consist of crushed rock, crushed gravel or other hard material retained on· 2.36 mm sieve. It shall be clean, hard, durable and cubical shape, free from dust and soft organic and other deleterious substances. The aggregate shall satisfy the physical requirements specified in Table 13.24 Where crushed gravel is proposed for use as aggregate, not less than 90 percent by weight of the crushed material retained on 4. 75 mm sieve shall have at least two fractured faces resulting from crushing operation. Before approval of the source, the aggregates shall be tested for stripping. Where the Contractor's selected sources of aggregates have poor affinity for bitumen, as a condition for the approval of that source, the bitumen shall be treated with approved anti-stripping agents, as per the manufacturer's recommendations, without additional payment.</p>

The type and quantity of bitumen and appropriate thickness shall confirm to limit given in Table 13.25.</p>
    
    <h3>(e) Proportioning of Material</h3>
    <p>The combined aggregate grading shall not vary from the lower limit on one sieve to the higher limit on the adjacent sieve to avoid gap grading. The aggregate may be proportioned and blended to produce a uniform mix complying with the requirements in Table 13.25. The binder content shall be within a tolerance of± 0.3 percent by weight of total mix when individual specimens are taken for quality control tests in accordance with the provisions of Table 5.2.</p>
