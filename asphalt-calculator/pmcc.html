    <h1>CLOSE-GRADED PREMIX SURFACING/MIXED SEAL SURFACING</h1>

    <h2>(1) Scope</h2>
    <h3>(a)</h3>
    <p>The work shall consist of the preparation, laying and compaction of a close graded premix surfacing material of 20 mm thickness composed of graded aggregrates premixed with a bituminous binder on a previously prepared surface, in accordance with the requirements of these Specifications, to serve as a wearing course.</p>
    
    <h3>(b)</h3>
    <p>Close graded premix surfacing shall be of Type A or Type B as specified in the Contract documents. Type A. grading is recommended for use in areas having rainfall more than 150 cm per year. In other areas Type B grading may be used.</p>

    <h2>(2) Materials</h2>
    
    <h3>(a) Binder</h3>
    <p>The binder shall be viscosity grade bitumen of a suitable grade as specified in the Contract, or as directed by the Engineer, and satisfying the requirements of IS: 73. For selection of grade of bitumen guidance may be taken from Table 13.1.</p>
    
    <h3>(b) Coarse Aggregates</h3>
    <p>The aggregates shall conform to Clause 1309 (.2) (b) except that the water absorption shall be limited to a maximum of 1 percent. The Polished Stone Value, shall not be less than 55, when tested as per BS: 812-114.</p>
    
    <h3>(c) Fine Aggregates</h3>
    <p>The fine aggregates shall consist of crushed rock, or natural sand or a mixture of both. These shall be clean, hard, durable, un-coated, mineral particles, dry; and free from injurious, soft or flaky particles and organic or deleterious substances.</p>
    
    <h3>(d) Aggregate Gradation</h3>
    <p>The coarse and fine aggregates shall be so graded or combined as to conform to one or the other grading's given in Table 13.35, as specified in the contract.</p>
    
    <table>

    </table>
    
    <h3>(e) Proportioning of Materials</h3>
    <p>The total quantity of aggregates used for Type A or B close-graded premix surfacing shall be 0.27 cubic meter per square meter area. The quantity of binder used for premixing shall be 22.0 kg and 19.0 kg per 10 square meter area for Type A and Type B surfacing respectively.</p>

    <h2>(3) Construction Operations</h2>
    
    <h3>(a) Weather and Seasonal Limitations</h3>
    <p>The provisions of Clause 1301 (5) shall apply.</p>
    
    <h3>(b) Preparation of Surface</h3>
    <p>The underlying surface on which the bituminous surfacing is to be laid shall be prepared, shaped and conditioned to the specified lines, grade and cross-section in accordance with Section 1100. A prime coat where needed shall be applied in accordance with Clause 1302 as directed by the Engineer.</p>
    
    <h3>(c) Tack Coat</h3>
    <p>A tack coat complying with Clause 1302, shall be applied over the base preparatory to laying of the surfacing.</p>
    
    <h3>(d) Preparation of Premix</h3>
    <p>Hot mix plant of appropriate capacity and type shall be used for the preparation of the mix material. The hot mix plant shall have separate dryer arrangement for heating aggregate.</p>
    <p>The temperature of the binder and aggregate at the time of mixing, laying and compaction shall be in conformity with the temperature given in Table 13.5. The difference in temperature between the binder and aggregate shall at no time exceed 14Â°C. Mixing shall be thorough to ensure that a homogeneous mix is obtained in which all particles of the aggregates are coated uniformly.</p>
    <p>The mix shall be immediately transported from the mixer to the point of use in suitable vehicles or hand barrows. The vehicles employed for transport shall be clean and the mix being transported covered in transit if so directed by the Engineer.</p>
    
    <h3>(e) Laying and Compaction</h3>
    <p>The pre mixed material shall be spread on a previously prepared base to Clause 1301 by a paver unless specified otherwise in the Contract to the desired thickness, grades and cross fall (camber). The cross-fall shall check by means of camber boards and irregularities levelled out. Excessive use of blades or rakes shall be avoid. As soon as sufficient length of bituminous material has been laid, rolling shall commence with 8-10 ton rollers, smooth wheel tandem type or other approved equipment. Rolling shall begin at the edge and progress towards the centre longitudinally, except that on super elevated and uni-directional cambered portions, it shall progress from the lower to upper edge parallel to the centre line of the pavement. When the roller has passed over the whole area once, any high spots or depressions, which become apparent, shall be corrected by removing or adding premixed materials. Rolling shall then be continued until the entire surface has been rolled and c: ill the roller marks eliminated. In each pass of the roller the preceding track shall be overlapped uniformly by at least one third width. The roller wheels shall be kept damp to prevent the premix from adhering to the wheels. In no case shall fuel/lubricating oil be used for this purpose. Excess use of water for this purpose shall also be avoided.</p>
    <p>Rollers shall not stand on newly laid material. Rolling operations shall be completed in every respect before the temperature of the mix falls below the rolling temperature indicated in Table 13.5.</p>

    <h2>(4) Opening to Traffic</h2>
    <p>Traffic may be allowed after completion of the final rolling when the mix has cooled down to the surrounding temperature. Speed restrictions may be imposed at initial stages.</p>

    <h2>(5) Surface Finish and Quality Control of Work</h2>
    <p>The surface finish of construction shall conform to the requirements of Section 1100. For control on the quality of materials and the works carried out, the relevant provisions of Section 600 shall apply.</p>

    <h2>(6) Arrangements for Traffic</h2>
    <p>During the period of construction, arrangements for traffic shall be in accordance with the provisions of Clause 104.</p>

    <h2>(7) Measurement</h2>
    <p>Close-graded premix surfacing, Type A or B shall be measured as finished work, for the area specified to be covered, in square meters at a specified thickness. The area will be the net area covered.</p>

    <h2>(8) Payment</h2>
    <p>Close-graded premix surfacing, Type A or B shall be paid as per contract unit rate which shall be the full and final compensation for the cost of compliance of all requirements of Clauses 1301 and 1310 in addition to those specified in Clause 112.</p>
