    <h1>Privacy Policy for Caputok</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Date of App Release]</p>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User-Uploaded Files:</strong> Caputok processes text files (e.g., followers and following lists) that you upload directly into the App. All processing occurs entirely on your device, and no data is transmitted to any external server or third-party service.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Storage Access:</strong> To allow the App to access and analyze the text files you upload. This permission is limited to the functionality of the App and is not used for any other purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Internet Access:</strong> To enable the display of ads. This is the only use of the internet by the App.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Data Usage and Internet Connectivity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Data Processing:</strong> All uploaded text files are processed exclusively on your device. No data from these files is sent to or stored on any external server or service.</li>
            <li><strong>Generated Results:</strong> Based on the data in your uploaded files, Caputok generates results, which are displayed within the App. These results are not shared with any third party.</li>
            <li><strong>Generated Links:</strong> Any links produced (e.g., https://tiktok.com/@username) are based on your input files. They serve as visual representations of the analysis and do not connect to any service unless you manually navigate to them outside the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Internet Access for Ads:</strong> Caputok uses internet connectivity solely to load advertisements. No personal data or user behavior data is collected, stored, or shared by Caputok for advertising purposes.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
       <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Caputok integrates third-party services primarily for advertising purposes. These services may require limited internet access and might collect non-personally identifiable information, such as device details or usage statistics, to deliver targeted ads. However, Caputok does not share or store your personal data with these services.</p>
 </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. User Rights (EU GDPR Compliance)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> Since no data is stored or shared externally, there is no data stored by Caputok for you to access.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Deletion:</strong> Uploaded files and generated results can be deleted directly from your device.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy whenever the App is updated. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated policy. Please review this document periodically.</p>
